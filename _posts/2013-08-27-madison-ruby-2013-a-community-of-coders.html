<h1>Madison Ruby 2013: A Community of Coders</h1>

<p><i>This post originally appeared on the <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> blog. You can find the original version <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/3641-madison-ruby-2013-a-community-of-coders/">here</a>.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://madisonpl.us/ruby/">Madison Ruby</a> taught me that conferences are where you go to meet your heroes.</p>

<p>One thing that really drew me to Ruby as a language was its community, and when I first started learning to program, one of my greatest resources was Twitter. Because of its public and open nature, I was able to follow some of the thought leaders in the Ruby community and see what they were reading or reach out directly with questions. In this way, I felt like I was welcomed into the community with open arms.</p>

<p>And so when I started thinking about attending Ruby conferences, I reached out on Twitter for advice. I received lots of suggestions from respected developers for Madison Ruby, so I began investigating. Madison Ruby is what’s known as a “T-shaped” conference: the talks cover a broad range of topics with a deep spike into the Ruby language. This allows the conference to have in-depth coverage of Ruby and Rails, along with a taste of other relevant or interesting ideas.</p>

<p>Then something exciting happened—the Madison Ruby organizers reached out to me (via Twitter, of course) and I was invited to tell <a href={% post_url 2013-07-23-from-scientist-to-developer %}>my story</a> at a pre-conference event called <a href="http://hypeharvest.com">Hype Harvest</a>. Given that the main purpose of the event was to raise money for the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hypeharvest-nairobi-dev-school">Nairobi Dev School</a>, I was more than happy to contribute.</p>

<h2>Not your usual conference</h2>

<p>When the first morning of the conference kicked off with an improvised dance party, I knew Madison Ruby wasn’t going to be boring. How many other conferences have a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/dXKigdSQCb/">gnome</a> and a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/dX5nAkrBUb/">German Wheel</a> between the talks?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tenderlove/yak-shaving-is-best-shaving">talk</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove">Aaron Patterson</a> delivered was a perfect example of the Madison Ruby style: serious Ruby and Rails, with a side of silliness. The talk covered how a few performance improvements in Rails were brought about indirectly while troubleshooting a bug. Other highlights included a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/promptworks/the-eight-fingered-chef">Chef tutorial</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasongarber">Jason Garber</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a>’s emotional telling of <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/closure">CLOSURE</a>, the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why</a> and his relationship with the Ruby community.</p>

<p>The conference wrapped up with an Iron Coder event, where the audience was able to see what some of the top developers could do given a few constraints and a short amount of time. The developers were required to build an app using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoes_(GUI_toolkit)">Shoes</a> and to involve music in some way. Although I would have prefered to see the thought processes of some of the greats while they were coding, it was still impressive to see the results.</p>

<h2>Giving back</h2>

<p>The first few days of Madison Ruby were dedicated to workshops to help attendees become better developers. One of the workshops was a <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> event targeted to women interested in becoming Ruby on Rails developers. Because I know that even small events like this can change lives, I jumped at the opportunity to serve as a mentor for the event.</p>

<p>Working with the ladies at the event was inspiring and we were able to give each woman the tools she needs to start her journey as a developer. And as part of my Hype Harvest talk, I encouraged the other developers to continue giving back with events like <a href="http://railsgirls.com">RailsGirls</a> and RailsBridge. My own career path is proof that the efforts to increase diversity and bring more women into the community are working.</p>

<p>And of course, it was great to represent Big Nerd Ranch and to meet people who had taken our <a href="https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes">classes</a> or used our <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/">books</a> to learn to program. I was excited to share how Big Nerd Ranch has helped me to become a better developer. I also brought along a few Nerd glasses and made some new friends.</p>

<p>The greatest part about Madison Ruby was getting to meet some of the amazing people in the Ruby community. I met some of my Twitter friends in real life, and I was able to chat with some of my Ruby heroes. My career as a developer is just starting, but Madison Ruby has inspired me to become a better developer so that I can continue to give back.</p>
