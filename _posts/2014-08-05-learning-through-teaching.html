<h1>Learning Through Teaching</h1>

<p>I wrote a blog post about a few things I learned while teaching the <a href="https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes/ruby-on-the-server">Ruby on the Server</a> course for the <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> blog. You can find it <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/learning-through-teaching/">here</a>.</p>
