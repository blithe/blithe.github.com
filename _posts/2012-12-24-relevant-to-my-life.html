<p>"One final word of advice: Every programmer becomes paralyzed by irrational fear starting a new large project. They then use procrastination to avoid confronting this fear and end up not getting their program working or even started. I do this. Everyone does this. The best way to avoid this is to make a list of things you should do, and then do them one at a time.</p>
<p>Just start doing it, do a small version, make it bigger, keep a list of things to do, and do them."</p>
