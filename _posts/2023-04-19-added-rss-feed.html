<h1>Added an RSS feed</h1>

<p>Now that <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> is becoming more of a thing, I'm starting to use RSS feeds to post to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@blithe">my account</a> there.</p>

<p>The other day, I used <a href="https://mastofeed.org">MastoFeed</a> to post my <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> photos via RSS and it <a href="https://mastodon.social/@blithe/110199201530115675">worked</a> really nicely.</p> 

<p>This inspired me to set up an RSS feed for my blog here (even though I don't write much). Because I'm using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, it was just a super easy <a href="https://github.com/blithe/blithe.github.com/commit/5430a231c4fc9bdb4e5a85481ef0f94ad2984ac2">config change</a> and all my posts were set up in a feed.</p>

<p>Hopefully when I commit and push this post to <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> it automatically gets posted to Mastodon. If you're reading this post, you can go check <a href="https://mastodon.social/@blithe">my account</a> to see if it worked or not.</p>
