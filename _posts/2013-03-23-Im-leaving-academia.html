<h1>I'm leaving academia</h1>


<p>Though it may come as a shock to most of the people that know me, my career as a scientist and academic is effectively coming to a close. When the time came to apply for the tenure track academic positions that I had prepared my entire academic life for, I let it slip by without taking action. This is extremely out of character for me so I thought I would write a post to explain a few things.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>For anyone in academic circles, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17723223">it's</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/10/173953052/are-there-too-many-phds-and-not-enough-jobs?">no</a> <a href="http://www.psmag.com/science/the-real-science-gap-16191/">secret</a> that there is an abundance of PhDs and a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/education/20adjunct.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&">shortage</a> of academic positions. I suppose I learned this during graduate school even though all of the people I knew had no problems getting jobs after graduation. I knew that only a few "cream-of-the-crop” people could get academic jobs. I believed that by being the best, having the best resume, and making connections I would be able to get one of the few prized tenure-track academic positions.</p>

<p>When the time came to apply to tenure-track positions, I realized that even the best PhDs are susceptible to the lack of available positions. In my case, liberal arts schools often only have one tenure-track physical chemist employed in the entire chemistry department. In order for a position to open, a very specific person has to retire.</p>

<p>That's not to say I couldn't get <i>a</i> job. Departments often compensate for a lack of tenure-track positions (due to budget crunches) by hiring adjunct faculty to fulfill teaching requirements. For those unfamiliar with the term "adjunct," imagine working full time at a job that requires a PhD and has no benefits (insurance, 401k, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally, there are some positions available where older faculty have retired. A qualified person willing to move anywhere in the world should be able to find a position somewhere. For those with families, or other location restrictions, moving to another country or to a remote location is not an option. At the very least, it is not a desirable option.</p>

<p>During the job search, I found myself questioning my career choice. As a smart and highly educated person, was this really the best way to use my talents? Would I really be happy teaching away from my friends and family? Would fulfilling this career goal be enough for me for the rest of my life? Was there a better, more financially rewarding, and gratifying option?</p>

<p>Working through grad school taught me that I could do <i>anything</i> if I put my mind to it. I want to make sure that I am using my mind in the best way possible for myself, my loved ones, and for the world. I no longer believe that academia or science is the best use of my talents.</p>

<h2>If not academia, then what?</h2>
<p>In the mean time, I started some web development side projects (Ruby on Rails) and I've become pretty good at it. The huge demand for programmers (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/womens-pipeline-to-programming-jobs-has-many-leaks.html">particularly women</a>) has made me consider this as a career option. Within a few years (or maybe even the first year) I would be making more than I would as a tenure-track professor.</p>

<p>Even though my programming career is still relatively young, I think that I might find it more gratifying than science. The ability to imagine something and then create it from scratch on a short timescale is extremely empowering. I love being able to solve challenges on a daily basis that have a direct, visible result. I love being able to say “I built this.” Although I’m proud of the science that I’ve contributed to the world, I see programming as a way to have a more accessible, tangible impact.</p>

<p>I'm excited about the culture outside of academia and the opportunity to work with a variety of smart people. I’m looking forward to working in teams with fellow creatives who haven’t spent an entire lifetime learning about science. I also see this as an opportunity to learn more about different subjects like business, design, and management.</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts about the prospect of becoming a professor was the idea of being able to positively contribute to the world by teaching others. Luckily there are lots of opportunities to teach in tech and programming, so I don't feel like I'm losing that aspect.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>This summer, I plan to start with an entry-level web developer position and work my way up. I know that I can be a hell of a developer one day and I plan to use my life experience to get there as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>I realize this is pretty crazy after getting a PhD and it's very out of character for me. I have thought about it a lot and I see this more as a lateral move rather than as starting over. There are a lot of opportunities outside of academia and, for me, this move will be more beneficial than forging ahead on a career path that I chose in high school. I believe it will be more gratifying, offer more flexibility, and be more financially rewarding. I make this leap with no regrets.</p>

<p>This will be a huge change for me but I'm looking forward to the possibilities. The future is bright.</p>
