<h1>I'm a Big Nerd</h1>


<p>Today is the first day of my <a href="http://localhost:4000/2013/03/23/Im-leaving-academia.html">new career</a> as a professional web developer. I have accepted a position as a developer intern with <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> here in Atlanta. While I may be one of the only interns around with a PhD, I'm extremely excited about this opportunity.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Big Nerd Ranch is the best place to work as a developer in Atlanta. They are stocked with a group of world-class developers for me to work with and learn from. They help maintain some of the most useful <a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2012/11/28/myron-marston-and-andy-lindeman-are-rspecs-new-project-leads/">open-source projects</a>. They've written some pretty amazing <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/books">books</a> about programming and they've even <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/05/whys-facebooks-app-so-much-better-lately-ask-big-nerd-ranch/">trained over 450 Facebook engineers</a>.</p>

<p>Big Nerd Ranch has already been instrumental in my development as a programmer. I first encountered a few Nerds at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlantaruby/">Atlanta Ruby Users Group</a> (which they help organize) but I really got to know a lot of the developers at the <a href="http://blitherocher.com/2012/12/04/rails-girls-atlanta.html">Rails Girls Atlanta</a> workshop. They were clearly a company that valued a great developer community in Atlanta and I knew I wanted to be a part of that.</p>

<p>I already feel like Big Nerd Ranch is home for me and I can't wait to get started on building some really awesome projects. I can't think of a better place to start my career as a developer.</p>
