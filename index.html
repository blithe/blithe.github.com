<h2>About</h2>
<p>Blithe Rocher is a web developer at <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. At BNR she uses <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> to develop web applications internally and for external clients. Prior to becoming a developer, she received a PhD in physical chemistry from the <a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, Blithe volunteers as part of the <a href="http://railsgirls.com/atl">Rails Girls Atlanta</a> organization both as a coach for the free workshop for women interested in learning about programming and as a co-organizer of the monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/">Rails Girls ATL Meetup</a> group.</p>

<p>When she's not crafting web applications, she spends time traveling, riding her <a href="http://app.strava.com/athletes/13682">bike</a>, or with her dog <a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7190/6839760614_4b2fbf6783_b.jpg">Nola</a>.</p>
